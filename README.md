Streaming Analytics Pipeline & Dashboard

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow using Python, PostgreSQL, and Streamlit.
Raw MovieLens datasets are ingested, transformed into structured analytics tables, and queried to produce insights on user activity, rating trends, and genre performance.
The final output is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that visualizes:
Top movies by rating volume and average score
Daily engagement metrics over time
Genre-level performance comparisons
This project simulates a real data engineering and analytics pipeline, showcasing database design, SQL querying, and dashboard development in a production-style workflow.
